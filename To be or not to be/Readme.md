# Project: To be or not to be

This project evolves a line of text from randomly generated strings, using a classic genetic algorithm, modeled as a simplistic version of genetic evolution in the real world. The code(.h files) is well documented.

Credits to Dan Shiffman's playlist on Genetic Algorithms for teaching me this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bJM3VgzjNV5YxVxUwzALHV" target="_blank"> Check it out. </a>

### DNA Class:
Contains the base DNA of text object.

### Population Class:
Contains a population of several members with different DNAs, which were made using the DNA class.
