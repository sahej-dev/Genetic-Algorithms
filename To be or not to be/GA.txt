1. Select those with higher fitness favorably, from the population,
    and build a mating pool.
2. Select two different parents from the mating pool randomly (or according to fitness
    if not building a mating pool) and cross them over. ie get a child.
3. Generate a new population using the children from step 2.
4. Go to step 1.


How to generate comparison doubles?
1. map(DNA.fitness, 0, 100, 0, total_fitness)
    ie DNA.fitness/total_fitness * 100
        maybe remove the floor later if not working as expected.
        scratch that, remove the floor.


Function to compare and select?
r = random(0ld, 100ld)

// example
a = 10, b = 50, c = 40;
while (true)
    if      (r < pa + 0)             return a;
    else if (r < pb + pa)        return b;
    else if (r < pc + (pb + pa)) return c;



// our use case
net_prob = 0;
for (int = 0; i < population.size(); i++)
{
    if (r < prob[i] + net_prob) return population[i];

    net_prob += prob[i]
}
